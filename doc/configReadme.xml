As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize Opportunities between Salesforce and Netsuite.

This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating Opportunities from Salesforce instance to Netsuite, being able to specify filtering criteria and desired behaviour when an Opportunity already exists in the destination system. 

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in  Input, Process and On Complete stages.

During the Input stage the Anypoint Template will go to the Salesforce and query all the existing Opportunities that match the filter criteria. Account in Salesforce is represented by Customer in Netsuite. In the Saleforce it is possible to have an Opportunity without associated Account but in the Netsuite the Customer field is required in the Opportunity. The template would not work correctly if there would be migrated an Opportunity without an Account.

In the Process stage the Opportunity is fetched from Netsuite by its externalId equal to Salesforce Opportunity ID. In next batch step Customer is looked up by Opportunity Account name. If the Customer is found first one is selected to be used in Netsuite Opportunity. If it is not found, then new Customer is created with user defined subsidiary.

The last step of the Process stage will upsert the Opportunities in Netsuite based on the externalId field of the Netsuite Opportunity which should match the Salesforse Opportunity Id.

Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will print output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

In any of the ways you would like to run this Anypoint Template this is an example of the output you'll see after hitting the HTTP endpoint:

<pre>
<h1>Batch Process initiated</h1>
<b>ID:</b>6eea3cc6-7c96-11e3-9a65-55f9f3ae584e<br/>
<b>Records to Be Processed: </b>9<br/>
<b>Start execution on: </b>Thu Apr 23 08:05:33 CEST 2015

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdc2netsOpportunityMigration` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sfdc2netsOpportunityMigration.cloudhub.io/migrateopportunities` and report will be sent to the emails configured.

After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local http endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/migrateopportunities` and this will create a CSV report and send it to the mails set.

Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, we make API call to Salesforce only once during migration, so this is not something to worry about.

This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Anypoint Template has a [HTTP Listener Connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Listener+Connector) as the way to trigger the use case.

$H$H# Trigger Flow
**HTTP Listener Connector** - Start Report Generation

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateopportunities` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `0.0.0.0`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Opportunities synced and filtered by the criteria specified.

Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the pourpose of this particular Anypoint Template the *mainFlow* just excecutes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). which handles all the logic of it:

1. Job execution is invoked from triggerFlow (endpoints.xml).
2. During the Process stage, each Opportunity will be filtered based on specified criteria. Then it is checked if it has an existing matching Opportunity in the Netsuite instance. The matching is performed by querying a Netsuite instance for an entry with externalId same as the given Salesforce Opportunity Id.
3. Account associated with Salesforce Opportunity is migrated to Customer associated with Opportunity in Netsuite. The matching is performed by querying a Netsuite instance for an entry with companyName same as the given Salesforce Account name.
4. The next step will insert a new record into the Netsuite instance if there was none found in the previous step or update the existing one.
5. The final step will be sending execution report with statistics to email adresses set.


This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
